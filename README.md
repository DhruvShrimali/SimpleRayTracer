# SimpleRayTracer
##V1 - This tracer only checks if light rays are intersecting with spheres
##V2 - This is a more realistic tracer that returns light only when it reaches a light source through reflections
##V3 - This is an even more realistic tracer that also allows transparent objects thus including refraction too
