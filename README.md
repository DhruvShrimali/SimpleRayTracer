# Simple Ray Tracer
I decided to make this ray tracer as part of my Human Computer Intercation course. <br>
Ray tracing, a foundational method in computer graphics, is employed to create lifelike images by simulating the trajectory of light rays interacting with scene elements.<br>
The original objectives were:
<ol>
<li>Implementing a simple ray-tracing algorithm suitable for a simple scene.</li>
<li>Rendering a static scene with a room, movable shapes (constrained to a couple balls), a fixed light source, and a camera.</li>
<li>Generating an image render depicting the scene with basic lighting effects and object interactions.</li>
</ol>

## Setup
Required python librares (for PNG generation from V1.2 onwards):
```bash
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Run (latest version)
```bash
cd v5
sh rayTracer.sh
```
